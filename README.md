This is a script that will take care of the process of configuring your Linux machine to use the Yubikey one time password device as a second factor of authentication. 

This script is tested and confirmed to work on the following distributions: 
 * Debian/squeeze (version 6)
 * Ubuntu versions 10.04 lucid, 10.10 maverick, 11.04 natty, 11.10 oneiric and 12.04 precise (using travis)

If you try it out in another distribution, please confirm if it works or contribute if it doesn't :)

Updates are automatically tested using Travis CI, [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rickard2/Yubikey-PAM-Installer.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rickard2/Yubikey-PAM-Installer)

Currently Travis CI is using Ubuntu server 12.04
