This is a script that will take care of the process of configuring your Linux machine to use the Yubikey one time password device as a second factor of authentication. 

This script is tested and confirmed to work on the following distributions: 
 * Debian/squeeze (version 6)
 * Ubuntu versions 10.04 lucid, 10.10 maverick, (11.04 natty?) and 11.10 oneiric 

If you try it out in another distribution, please confirm if it works or contribute if it doesn't :)

Suggestions and feedback always appreciated
